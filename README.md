# Summary good-developer-mindset.

“Difficult to make even small changes” “Breaking functionality of 
the software by making changes” “Introducing a new bug by fixing 
another one” .

“Implementing code that is unnecessary” “Almost impossible to add 
a new feature because of complicated code” “The never-shipping 
product” .

“Throwing code away and rewriting it from scratch” Are all the 
above statements familiar?

They write thousands of lines of code to design Y. In the future, 
the developer realizes that the current requirements are 
completely different than what they thought.

To avoid being a victim like this developer, follow this simple 
rule: Code should be designed based on what you know now, not on 
what you think will happen in the future. 

However, if, somehow you make these mistakes and find yourself 
thinking about rewriting your code, here is the main thing that 
you should know: Rewriting code is often a developer delusion, not the solution in most cases.

This is why our subconscious mind whispers to us “Throw it away 
and start over” when we read another developer’s code.

Don’t be in the unnecessary discussion like Microsoft vs Linux :) 
Know that every specific problem has its own specific solution.
